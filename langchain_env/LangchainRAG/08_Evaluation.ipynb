According to a YouGov survey, 48% of American workers believe that the advancement of AI will lead to a decrease in available jobs, while 34% express concerns about job loss, reduced working hours, or decreased wages due to AI. However, 63% of respondents do not worry about job loss or changes in working conditions related to AI, and only a small percentage (2%) reported having experienced job loss or reduced hours/wages due to AI. Overall, there is a significant divide in perceptions, with some fearing negative impacts while others remain optimistic.',\n",

As a result, the legislation did not become law.',\n",

       " \"The signing of the global AI treaty by the US, UK, and EU has several implications for AI governance and ethics:\\n\\n1. **Legal Framework**: The treaty establishes a legal framework for AI governance, emphasizing the protection of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the deployment of AI systems. This marks a significant step towards creating binding international standards for AI.\\n\\n2. **National Implementation**: Signatory countries are required to adopt legislative or administrative measures to implement the treaty domestically. This could lead to a more uniform approach to AI regulation across these nations, although the specifics may vary based on national contexts.\\n\\n3. **Focus on Human Rights**: The treaty prioritizes the protection of individuals affected by AI systems, promoting principles such as human dignity, autonomy, transparency, accountability, equality, and non-discrimination. This focus on human rights could influence how AI technologies are developed and deployed.\\n\\n4. **Concerns about Scope and Enforcement**: There are concerns regarding the treaty's effectiveness due to its broad principles and the delegation of regulatory authority over the private sector to individual countries. This could result in inconsistent application of the treaty's provisions and potential loopholes, particularly regarding national security exemptions.\\n\\n5. **Global Participation**: The treaty has the potential to encourage other countries to sign and commit to similar standards, fostering a more collaborative international approach to AI governance.\\n\\n6. **Balancing Innovation and Regulation**: The treaty aims to balance the need for innovation in AI with the necessity of ethical considerations and regulatory oversight, which could shape the future landscape of AI development.\\n\\nOverall, while the treaty represents a significant advancement in international AI governance, its practical implications will depend on how effectively countries implement and enforce its provisions.\",\n",

By reporting on the biases and transparency issues associated with such benchmarks, TechCrunch raises awareness among researchers, developers, and the general public about the limitations of current evaluation methods. This can lead to more informed discussions and potentially drive improvements in how AI models are assessed, ensuring that evaluations better reflect the needs and preferences of a broader user base rather than just a niche, technology-focused audience.',\n",
       " \"If California's Bill SB 1047 on AI had passed, it would have imposed various safety measures on AI companies developing foundational models. These measures would have required AI companies to conduct safety assessments regarding the risks associated with their models and implement functionalities to quickly halt the model in case of unexpected risks. Additionally, the bill would have granted the California Attorney General the authority to sue AI developers in cases of serious harm caused by AI, such as death or property damage.\\n\\nHowever, the bill faced criticism for potentially hindering the development of open-source projects and small AI companies. It was also noted that the bill primarily focused on regulating large and expensive AI models, without adequately addressing the risks associated with smaller models that might handle sensitive data. The rejection of the bill by Governor Gavin Newsom suggests that there was a belief that it did not represent the best approach to addressing the threats posed by AI technology.\",\n",
       " '400M 매개변수는 자연어 처리(NLP)와 컴퓨터 비전(CV) 분야에서 AI 모델의 성능에 중요한 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 매개변수의 수가 많을수록 모델은 더 복잡한 패턴을 학습할 수 있으며, 이는 더 높은 성능으로 이어질 가능성이 큽니다. \\n\\n특히, 연구 결과에 따르면 코드 데이터가 포함된 모델은 자연어 추론 작업에서 텍스트만으로 훈련된 모델보다 지속적으로 더 좋은 성능을 보였으며, 400M에서 28억 개 매개변수까지 다양한 규모에서 모델의 성능이 평가되었습니다. 이는 매개변수 수가 증가함에 따라 모델이 더 많은 정보를 처리하고, 더 정교한 예측을 할 수 있는 능력이 향상된다는 것을 시사합니다.\\n\\n따라서, 400M 매개변수를 가진 모델은 NLP와 CV 작업에서 기본적인 성능을 제공할 수 있으며, 추가적인 데이터와 훈련 방법에 따라 성능이 더욱 개선될 수 있습니다.']"
